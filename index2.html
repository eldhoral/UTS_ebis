            Deskripsi Video <br>
            The goal of the Apple Watch was to complement an iPhone and add new functions, and to free people from their phones.
            Kevin Lynch was hired by Apple to make wearable technology for the wrist. He said: "People are carrying their phones with them and looking at the screen so much. People want that level of engagement. But how do we provide it in a way that's a little more human, a little more in the moment when you're with somebody?"[48] Apple's development process was held under wraps until a Wired article revealed how some internal design decisions were made.
